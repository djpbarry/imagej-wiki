# Overview

This tutorial demonstrates how to
1. Use [the macro recorder](../scripting/macro.md#the-recorder) to record a series of commands to form the basis of a macro
2. Edit the output from the macro recorder so that it can be run on any open image
3. Enclose the code from step 2 inside a loop so that it runs on multiple images
4. Add a dialog so that a user can modify the parameters to the macro prior to execution
